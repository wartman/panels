        /* This should be ignored /*and can be nested!*/ */

We open on a dark and stormy night. This first panel here should
be big -- really get that stormy atmosphere.

Maybe like [this](some/url.png) or something?

    CAPTION (Night)
    A dark and stormy night...

Fred turns to his friend. He looks around nervously.

    FRED FREDSON (OFF)
    Hey Bob, it sure is _stormy_ out here.
    (cont.)
    Kind of **scary** 

BOB BOBSMAN
You got that right, friend.

There is a long and awkward silence.

A lightning bolt comes out of nowhere and incinerates both characters. It is grisly and a bit horrifying.

But also funny.

Fade to black.

In a comic.

You can figure it out.
