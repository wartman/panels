We open on a dark and stormy night. This first panel here should be big -- really get that stormy atmosphere.

Maybe like [this](some/url.png) or something?

    CAPTION (Night)
    A dark and stormy night...

[]

Fred turns to his friend. He looks around nervously.

    /* 
        If the format of our character name is a bit weird, we can use the <dialog:...> fallback syntax.

        For completeness, this also works in other places -- <panel:...> will
        work too, for example.
    */ 
    <dialog:FRED Fredson> 
    <modifier:OFF>
    Hey Bob, it sure is _stormy_ out here.
    (cont.)
    Kind of *scary* 

    BOB BOBSMAN (VO)
    You got that right, friend.

There is a long and awkward silence.

A lightning bolt comes out of nowhere and incinerates both characters. It is grisly and a bit horrifying.

But also funny.

    SFX (Lightning)

Fade to black.

In a comic.

You can figure it out.
